## Kirill Zabrodin

I am a junior software developer that has a passion for computer hardware as well as software. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Hardware

I have been interested in hardware for nearly as long as I have been coding. I built my first PC when I was 15 and have been tinkering with hardware projects ever since. I have done Unifi network deployments and have worked with Microtik and OpenWRT both in terms of deployment and router OS flashing. I have worked as an assistant sys-admin at Fusion Asset Management and learned much from my experience there.

- PC building, network deployment and Microtik scripting, sys-admin and hardware upgrade for Fusion Asset Management.
- A full hardware upgrade of 15 PCs with data transfer and backup storage. 

#### Public Speaking

Having competed at Model United Nations (MUN) for over 3 years and having won at 10 conferences I am used to audiences both large and small. I can prepare my own speeches and arguing my point of view succinctly and strongly. Due to my leadership position within my delegation I have experience at organising people and working under pressure.

- I won best delegate at 12 conferences and teams I was part of won best delegation at 10.
- I implemented a policy of checking each otherâ€™s resolutions prior to conferences to improve our performance.
- I managed and maintained a simple application for recording attendance of practice sessions for MUN.

## Education

- I have been interested in code since 2009 when a teacher introduced me to BBC Basic. I have been coding ever since.

- Apart from working in groups in MUN I have also worked as part of a team in Fusion Asset Management. I thrive when I can bounce ideas between people within a working group and love doing so.
